## About
Hitachi H8/300 code disassembler dah8300 runs in DOS. It reads binary image of H8/300 code and types it in assembly language to the screen. The output can be redirected into a file. 

dah8300 was written in Forth programming language and compiled with [TCOM](http://www.karola.fi/rak/attic/about_tcom/), a public domain Forth compiler from Tom Zimmer. It is very handy with small programs as dah8300.

## Usage
Just type `dah8300` and you get help.

![help](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjaan/dah8300/main/sw_dah8300_help.png)

disassembling file to the screen: `dah8300 file`

disassembling file to the screen with pauses: `dah8300 file | more`

disassembling file1 to file2: `dah8300 file1 >file2`

`Esc` interrupts the disassembling and causes return to DOS.

## Output
The output is in five columns:

* H8/300 assembly instruction
* parameter(s) for the instruction
* program counter value (hexadecimal)
* machine code of the instruction (hexadecimal)
ASCII representation of the machine code (ASCII codes outside 32...126 range are displayed as dots)
